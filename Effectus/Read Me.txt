This application intentionally make use of as few 3rd party libraries as possible. This
is done in order to show as much as possible the principles, rather than the particular
implementations.

Database schema, including initial data, is in the Model/Schema.sql file

Connection string appears in the hibernate.cfg.xml file

* Note that every feature is isolated, and include presenter, view and view model.
* Note that we have a convention about writing up view events to presenter methods
  as part of the presenter initialization. It is important to observe that this 
  convention is not a general one, and was developed specifically for the purpose
  of this app, which significantly reduces the complexity.
  The convention is:
  * View events are wired by name. For example:
    "Loaded" event on the view will be wired to the "OnLoaded()" method on the presenter
  * Button commands are wired by name. For example:
    "MoveNext" button is wired to the "OnMoveNext()" method. The "CanMoveNext" property 
    is used to control whatever the button is enabled or disabled.
  * Grids double click is wired by name. For example:
    Double click on "Actions" will be wired to the "OnActionsChoosen(ToDoAction)"
* Invoking presenter with arguments can be done by calling:
  Presenters.Show("Edit", 5)
  And having the edit presenter expose a public method Initialize(long) for accepting
  the argument
